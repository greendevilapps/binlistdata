# BinlistData

This is a fork from [binlist/data](https://github.com/binlist/data).

I have manually rolled most of the pull requests from there into this repository as well.

## Full template

I have added the code needed to run this locally or on your own server.

*Warning:* I am not a node.js dev, so this is my first time with this. If there are any issues Please
add an issue or a pull request for me to fix anything.
